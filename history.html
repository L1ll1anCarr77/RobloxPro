			<p>The beta version of Roblox was created by co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004, which was named DynaBlocks. Baszucki tested the demos that year. In 2005, the company changed the name to Roblox and was launched on September 1, 2006. In March 2007, Roblox used COPPA(Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule) which restricted communication ability of users under the age of 13 years by restricting them to selecting predefined messages from a menu. In August, Roblox applied server improvements and released a premium membership service called "Builders Club"</p>
